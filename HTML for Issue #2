    <td><p><strong>Another Trip</strong></p>

  <p>
    Again I drive away, from my homemade lemon meringue pie, the fat cat named Ghost who I affectionately referred to as Cloud, and the remnants of a controlled burn I helped contain—so as not spread to the surrounding bush. In New Zealand, I’ve been volunteering on farms through Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF) interspersed between travel and work. This may have been my ninth farm? <em>I’m losing track.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    This most recent WWOOF host told me he had been cursed, saw a UFO, saw a ghost in his house, had many near death experiences, and was struck by lightening before. I’m not religious but I gave him my Image of Divine Mercy to help with his curse, since he said it was Christian-related. Nothing he revealed put me off the idea of staying there, more so I remember noting that I ought to write a fiction story about him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Already I sense that memories of this eccentric WWOOF host are fleeting while they mix with my colorful year. I drive North, to a place I’ve been to before. The idea of being on familiar land sits in my mind’s eye like a fresh baked cookie in an oven, while memories of being on the road flood my mind like radio chatter. The hitchhikers. <em>Where are they now?</em> Susi. <em>I hope she got home safe.</em> My farm hosts prior. <em>I hope they are able to keep the farm. With her injury and all.</em>
  </p>

  <p><em>
    My year was full of meetings and goodbyes. Flirting, loneliness, humor, intensity, stupidity, excitement, boredom, rapidity but never superficiality. Never putting on a persona or pretending. Imperfect human connection. Pure experience. That’s what it felt like, at least.
  </em></p>

  <p>
    I am on the road again, but my destination would become my home for three weeks. I am heading to Mana, a retreat center on the Coromandel, for my second stint of volunteering. Though I had been to the location eight months prior, there would be an entirely new batch of volunteers to meet, some who had been volunteering with each other for weeks already. The idea of meeting these new faces all at once made my gut churn.
  </p>

  <p><em>
    Social anxiety is not something you ever get rid of, I think. Even if you prove to everyone in the world you beat it, and are the most popular, charismatic, loved person on the planet, social anxiety would be sitting on your shoulder like an old friend. I don’t believe people ever fully rid themselves of their neuroses.
  </em></p>

  <p>
    I pull over on the side of the road, to the last beach before the retreat center, when driving in from the West. It is an inlet hidden from the road, with calm waters that sparkle in the sun. The surrounding hills are bright green and dotted with cows. They are close enough to be considered part of the immediate landscape. The rocks make me believe mermaids sunbathe here.
  </p>

  <p>
    I change into my bathing suit without a care in the world, since nobody can see me here, and jump in. The cool water flows around my body and I felt light. Though, the feeling in my chest tightens when I think about meeting the new group. <em>It’s only three weeks</em>, I assure myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    I get out, walk to my towel, and change back into my clothes. All of the sudden, I spot a group of six walking down the beach. I’ve never seen a group of people here before.
  </p>

  <p>
    My heart is racing now. <em>Is my face red?</em> “Gab? Is that you?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s Sarina!”<br>
    “Sarina!” he runs up and gives me a hug.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s Mana’s kiwi chef followed by the group of volunteers I was supposed to meet at Mana. He and I exchange words I can’t remember. The rest of the group walks up and I can feel eyes on me. <em>It’s strange feeling people’s gaze.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    We get in the water, and I mostly talk to Gab, because he is familiar and we have stuff to catch up on. He calls me Sabrina and I correct him. The volunteers clown him for “never” remembering their names. One volunteer played into it so much that he temporarily changed his name to “Gregorious”.
  </p>

  <p>
    We swim farther into the sea and a friendly girl whose name I don’t yet know starts chatting to me. She is earnest, open, and curious. <em>I hope we’ll be friends.</em>
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center; margin:10px 0;">~</p>

  <p>
    I’m outside the sauna with three girls who may have stolen my heart. <em>In three weeks?</em> If I didn’t experience it, I wouldn’t have believed it possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    We plan to meet here again. “A Mana reunion!”
  </p>

  <p>
    Though, meeting in the same place again seems like a miracle away. I want to fall in love with the whole world.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center; margin:10px 0;">~</p>

  <p><strong>A confession:</strong></p>

  <p>
    I dreamt about you. The other night. You and I were cuddling. Your grandpa appeared. He said to you, “This one here is a special connection.” Why was I shown this and not you? Should I have told you? Did you also have a dream you never told me about? I love you like a sister, but I know you know and feel the same. So maybe there’s nothing to say. We’ll feel it, together and apart.
  </p>

                              All the things I had imagined Hell to be<br />
                              Were images I made up with my fears<br />
                              Turns out, the world isn’t as merciless as I
                              thought<br />
                              And Hell is just a waiting room<br />
                              And benevolence is the rule<br />
                              And there is very little, perhaps nothing, to fear
