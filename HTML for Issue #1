It’s important to give attention to<br>
The rivers, creeks, streams, runoffs, condensations, fog banks, lagoons and oceans<br>
The rains, mists, showers, storms, hurricanes, tempests and crashing waves<br>
The pipes, puddles and wells<br>
The wastewater treatment and saltwater intrusion<br>
The frost and the vapor<br>
All have roles, good or bad<br>
Ultimately always good<br>
<br>
We are inside out fish<br>
Creatures evolved to hold the primordial ocean within us<br>
Thus, in order to honor<br>
Our very essence<br>
We must honor the water<br>
<br>
Water’s currents carry time<br>
And can carry us through it<br>
If you gave a spring a microphone<br>
Who would it talk about?<br>
Politicians who claim to rule<br>
But never visit<br>
Or those who dip their hands, paws, tails, tongues and toes<br>
In its bubbles of insulated streams?<br>

What story would it tell?<br>
The last 200 years, a blink<br>
Of a glacier’s eye<br>
Or the full geologic story<br>
From undersea sediment to uplifting<br>
To tens of thousands of years of indigenous stewardship?<br>
<br>
Water can shape a city<br>
Tell us where to build and where to not<br>
Until we put a levee over its mouth<br>
And we turn our building windows away<br>
From its beautiful banks<br>
So we can’t see it either<br>
<br>
What is the cost of ignoring<br>
What feeds us?<br>
What gives us delight?<br>
Where we’re from?<br>
<br>
The waters of the world<br>
All have roles, good or bad<br>
(read: inconvenient)<br>
Ultimately always good<br>
<br>
Water’s currents carry time<br>
And can carry us through it<br>
Especially now, as we approach<br>
The cliff’s edge of climatic instability<br>
In order to honor<br>
Our very essence<br>
We must honor the water

              Trumpets on the mountain. A plant with a view. You'll find her at the intersection of timber and lime, where the trees can't keep a foothold and stone juts into dazzling space, at the mercy of wind, water, and sun. With colors that defy description, tenacity that defies logic, she clings to windswept outcrops with the utmost self-assurance. Equally tenacious alpine bumblebees find her blooms irresistible, when they find them at all, since she flowers only for a brief flicker before her lapis-lilac spouts shrivel and shed, leaving ghostly glaucous rosettes the only indication she was here at all: come again.

              I spent the last two summers in central Montana, the beginning or end of the great plains depending on which way you're headed, a land few people visit but with which I have become deeply enamored. The mountainous front of the Rockies here quickly dissipates into rolling hills and wide coulees, an eminently walkable topography that invites exploration and inquiry for those with great stamina and a subtle eye. Anomalously rising from this gently undulating land are numerous small mountain ranges far less known than the storied Rocky Mountains: the Belts, the Judiths, the Moccasins, the Crazies, the Highwoods, and (my personal favorite) the Snowies. Each of these ranges, due to their location amidst a sea of flatland, becomes more than the apparently meager sum of its parts. Rather, these ranges represent what biogeographers call "sky islands": pockets of montane or alpine habitat located far from the next nearest comparable system and thus isolated like islands in the sea. As islands support life which could not exist anywhere between them, so too do these ranges support a unique flora often more akin to the Rocky cordillera, despite being sometimes more than a hundred miles distant.

              The Big Snowy Mountains are especially dramatic in this regard, since not only do they rise 4000 feet or more above the surrounding plains but are composed almost entirely of limestone, a substrate which itself has a habit of selecting for unique floral assemblages capable of tolerating the alkaline soil it creates. Indeed, walking across the east-west spine of the Big Snowies presents one with an ecosystem unlike any other: forests of stunted pine, douglas-fir and spruce suddenly give way at the highest elevations to an otherworldly checkerboard of low-growing forbs clustered against the wind and snow, dark round patches dotting the gleaming white rock. Here Montana earns its name land of the big sky, which stretches endlessly away in all directions to the silhouettes of the next isolated range. Come at the right time of year and this brilliant plateau erupts in a riot of color and form, the tough alpine plants disclosing a softer side of themselves: mountain avens and saxifrage emerge white, yellow and elegant from their tufted rosettes; bladderpods and cinquefoils shine like the rays of the sun; fleabanes, rockjasmines, and skypilots turn purple with envy; bistorts and alp-lilies sprout stalks white as cloud and just as delicate... But one player has already come and gone.
            </p>

              Ask a hundred people why they climb a mountain and you'll likely get close to a hundred different answers: wildlife, vistas, exercise, escape, hunting, fishing, fresh air... All manner of reasons to explore and appreciate the great outdoors expressed by the diverse array of smiling faces you'll encounter there. Some people fancy themselves peak-baggers, glory seekers who find their quarry by being the highest thing around, if only for a moment before waning sun and itchy feet force them to relinquish this title to the mountain once more. Why climb the same mountain twice, they might ask, when there are so many others to choose from? To find what you missed before.

              After failing to see Jones' columbine my first year in Montana I made it my mission to climb the summit of the Big Snowy Mountains as many times as necessary until I could lay my eyes on this most triumphant and ephemeral beauty. This year I got my wish. Emerging at last from the conifer krummholz, lungs burning, legs on ascending autopilot, eyes tracing every bare patch of ground, I saw her. Violet as the sky before rain, fleeting as a smile, a single bloom tilted softly skyward with slender trumpets silently announcing, she was there. At last in her presence, I collapsed in prostration on the calcareous ground and wept tears of overwhelming joy. Life is good.

        These are very beginner friendly and supportive.
        The main purpose is to support your establishing a regular practice. The benefits of daily meditation
        are too tremendous to even be spoken, yet anecdotal and scientific evidence abound.
