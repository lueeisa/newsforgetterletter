                              I went to Hell earlier this week<br />
                              It was not what I was expecting<br />
                              It was a blue grey room<br />
                              Furnished with a couch and a desk<br />
                              Elevator music playing in the background<br />
                              They even had a bowl of those mints you get at
                              banks or at restaurants<br />
                              <br />

                              Where were the melting souls<br />
                              Sizzling in their own agony?<br />
                              Where were the sadistic demons<br />
                              Salivating to torture you for all of eternity<br />
                              With the very things you had been so attached to
                              in your sinful life?<br />
                              <br />
                              Nowhere to be seen.<br />
                              All the things I had imagined Hell to be<br />
                              Were images I made up with my fears<br />
                              Turns out, the world isn’t as merciless as I
                              thought<br />
                              And Hell is just a waiting room<br />
                              And benevolence is the rule<br />
                              And there is very little, perhaps nothing, to fear

                  The world  can be heavy,  chaotic, complicated and yet
                  painstakingly boring.  At times, life feels so serious and it can
                  be difficult to remind ourselves to appreciate the simple
                  beauty that surrounds us. I hope these little practices add a
                  touch of silly whimsy to your inner landscape.
                  
                  Give a name to every squirrel you see today. Maybe one inspires you to create a backstory…
                  Research the first birdsong you hear when you wake up.  Learn all the cool facts about that bird and share with your friends or coworkers!
                  Whisper a wish into your morning tea/coffee/beverage before taking a sip. Consider it true."
